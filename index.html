    My favorite culture that I'm not native to would be South Korea.
    They have fantastic infratructure for technology and gaming, and have some of the largest arcades in the world.

    A meal that represents me is Shawarma.

    Two historical figures I relate to are Isaac Newton and Friedrich Nietzsche. They both pushed the bounds of creativity and thought process to discover new ideas.

    I feel most creative when it's past midnight.
